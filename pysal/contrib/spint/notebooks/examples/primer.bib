	abstract = {Although the assumption of independence among interaction flows frequently is engaged in spatial interaction modeling, in many circumstances it leads to misspecified models and incorrect inferences. An informed approach is to explicitly incorporate an assumed relationship structure among the interaction flows, and to explicitly model the network autocorrelation. This paper illustrates such an approach in the context of U.S. interstate migration flows. Behavioral assumptions, similar to those of the intervening opportunities or the competing destinations concepts, exemplify how to specify network flows that are related to particular origin-destination combinations. The stepwise incorporation of eigenvectors, which are extracted from a network link matrix, captures the network autocorrelation in a Poisson regression model specification context. Spatial autocorrelation in Poisson regression is measured by the test statistic of Jacqmin-Gadda et al. (Stat Med 16(11):1283-1297, 1997). Results show that estimated regression parameters in the spatial filtering interaction model become more intuitively interpretable.},

There is currently a rapid expansion in the development of such techniques but their history almost exactly parallels that of Geographical Analysis, with the first examples of local analysis appearing in the late 1960s. Indeed, Geographical Analysis has published many of the significant contributions in this field. This paper reviews the development of local forms of spatial analysis and assesses the current situation. Following a discussion on the nature and importance of local analysis, examples are given of local forms of point pattern analysis; local graphical approaches; local measures of spatial dependency; the spatial expansion method; adaptive filtering; multilevel modeling; geographically weighted regression; random coefficients models; autoregressive models; and local forms of spatial interaction models.},

The single parameter of the model follows a universal law that depends only on the scale of the geographic units.

The analysis is performed both at macroscopic scales, i.e. at the national scale, and at microscopic scales, i.e. at the city level. It is shown that the thermodynamic limit assumption for the original radiation model significantly underestimates the commuting flows for large cities. We then generalize the radiation model, introducing the correct normalisation factor for finite systems. We show that even if the gravity model has a better overall performance the parameter-free radiation model gives competitive results, especially for large scales.},

Here, we present a population-weighted opportunities model without any adjustable parameters to capture the underlying driving force accounting for human mobility patterns at the city scale. We use various mobility data collected from a number of cities with different characteristics to demonstrate the predictive power of our model. We find that insofar as the spatial distribution of population is available, our model offers universal prediction of mobility patterns in good agreement with real observations, including distance distribution, destination travel constraints and flux. In contrast, the models that succeed in modelling mobility patterns in countries are not applicable in cities, which suggests that there is a diversity of human mobility at different spatial scales. Our model has potential applications in many fields relevant to mobility behaviour in cities, without relying on previous mobility measurements.},
